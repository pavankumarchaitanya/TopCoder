            Class Name: Numerology
Method Name: getMagicNumber
Parameters: String
Returns: int

Implement a class Numerology, which contains a method getMagicNumber.
getMagicNumber takes a String that is a person's name and returns a "magic
number" based upon that person's name.

Here is the method signature:
public int getMagicNumber(String strName);
* The input is a String of length 1 to 50, inclusive.
* The input contains characters A-Z, a-z, and spaces only.

The "magic number" is computed in the following manner:
- Each letter (regardless of case) of the name is given a value according to
its position in the alphabet.  Thus, "A" has a value of 1 because it is the 1st
letter of the alphabet, and "Z" has a value of 26 because it is the 26th letter
of the alphabet.
- The name is given a total value based upon the sum of the values of the
letters (ignore spaces) in it.  Thus, the name "Joe" would have a value of
10+15+5, which is 30.
- The digits of the total value are summed until the sum is less than 10.  So,
a total value of 128 is summed to 11 (1+2+8), and 11 is summed to give 2 (1+1).
 This is the magic number returned.

Examples (quotes are for clarity ONLY):
"Mandy Dean Thompson" has a magic number of 3.  (201 = 2+1 = 3)
"Nate Tina Tanner"    has a magic number of 3.  (156 = 1+5+6 = 12 = 1+2 = 3)
"Paul Tim Brown"      has a magic number of 2.  (164 = 1+6+4 = 11 = 1+1 = 2)
"Ralph Amber Black"   has a magic number of 6.  (123 = 1+2+3 = 6)
"Bill Susan Burton"   has a magic number of 1.  (199 = 1+9+9 = 19 = 1+9 = 10 =
1+0 = 1)
