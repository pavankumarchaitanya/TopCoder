            Class Name: MayanCalendar
Method Name: getDate
Parameters: int
Returns: String

Write a class MayanCalendar, which contains a method getDate. getDate takes an
int representing the number of days that have passed since the beginning of the
Mayan Calander, and returns a String representing the date.

Here is the method signature:
public String getDate(int iDays);
* iDays is an int from 0 to 9999999, inclusive

A Mayan date has three parts: the "Long Count", the "Tzolkin", and the "Haab".
The Mayan calendar starts on the date 13.0.0.0.0, 4 Ahau 8 Cumku (this is day
0).  The "13.0.0.0.0" is the Long Count, the "4 Ahau" is the Tzolkin, and the
"8 Cumku" is the Haab.  Each part is explained below.

The Long Count----------------
The long count is made up of 5 elements: the baktun, katun, tun, uinal, and
kin.  1 kin is equal to 1 day.  1 uinal is equal to 20 kin (20 days).  1 tun is
equal to 18 uinal (360 days). 1 katun is equal to 20 tun (7200 days).  1 baktun
is equal to 20 katun (144,000 days).

         13.1.2.3.4
         ^^ ^ ^ ^ ^
         ^^ ^ ^ ^ kin
         ^^ ^ ^ uinal
         ^^ ^ tun
         ^^ katun
         baktun

     The kin's place can have a value from 0 to 19.
     The uinal's place can have a value from 0 to 17.
     The tun's place can have a value from 0 to 19.
     The katun's place can have a value from 0 to 19.
     The baktun's place can have a value from 1 to 13.

When the calendar advances by a day, the kin's place is increased by 1.
If this would put the kin's place greater than its maximum value of 19, then
the kin's place is made 0, and the uinal's place is increased by 1.  (This is
just like regular addition; you carry 1 to the next place and set the current
place to the lowest value when a place is filled.)  The day following
13.19.19.17.19 is 1.0.0.0.0.

The Tzolkin-------------------
The Tzolkin has two elements, a number from 1 to 13, and twenty different names
(given as an array in the solution): Ahau, Imix, Ik, Akbal, Kan, Chicchan,
Cimi, Manik, Lamat, Muluc, Oc, Chuen, Eb, Ben, Ix, Men, Cib, Caban, Etznab, and
Caunac.  The number advances every day until it is 13.  Then, it resets back to
1.  The names advance every day in order until they reach Caunac, then they
begin again at Ahau.  Thus, 4 Ahau is followed by 5 Imix, which is followed by
6 Ik, etc.

The Haab----------------------
The haab is composed of 18 "months" of 20 days followed by one "month" of 5
days (also given as an array in the solution).  The regular 18 "months" are
Pop, Uo, Zip, Zotz, Tzec, Xul, Yaxkin, Mol, Chen, Yax, Zac, Ceh, Mac, Kankin,
Muan, Pax, Kayab, and Cumku.  The 5 day "month" is named Uayeb.  The days of
the regular "months" are numbered from 0 to 19.  Uayeb's days are numbered from
0 to 4.  Thus, 18 Cumku is followed by 19 Cumku, which is followed by 0 Uayeb,
etc.

Note:
*In the Txolkin and Haab, each word does not always correspond to the same
number.  
*Day 0 is "13.0.0.0.0, 4 Ahau 8 Cumku".
*The return String is of the form "&lt;Long
Count&gt;&lt;comma&gt;&lt;space&gt;&lt;Tzolkin&gt;&lt;space&gt;&lt;Haab&gt;". The long count contains 5 integers
(no leading zeroes) with a period between each. The Tzolkin consists of an
integer (with no leading zeroes), a space, and a word. The Haab consists of an
integer (with no leading zeros), a space, and a word.
